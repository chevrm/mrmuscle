NOTE: 	THIS SOFTWARE HAS BEEN RELEASED WITH THE HOPE THAT ALL WHO IMPLIMENT
	IT INTO WORKFLOWS THAT LEAD TO PUBLICATIONS, CITE APPROPRIATELY.

	Collaborations requesting custom implimentations of mrmuscle are
	welcome; contact via email above.

Summary:
	MrMuscle is a pipeline for the creation of extremely high confidence
	phylogentic trees leveraging the MUSCLE sequence aligner and MrBayes 
	Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo models.

Installation:
	- Download master.zip from github.com/chevrm/mrmuscle
	- Unpack and run ./install.sh from within the master directory

	Note: for systems with bioperl installed from CPAN, source, or 
	methods other than apt, 
	> sh ./src/install-nobioperl.sh 
	may be run instead of ./install.sh

Dependancies (installed by install-mm if necessary)
	- bioperl
	- MUSCLE
	- MrBayes
	- FigTree

Optional:
	Add mrmuscle dir to your path and .bashrc.
		OR
	Make a symbolic link in your bin (or another dir in $PATH)
	> ln -s /full/path/to/mrmuscle ~/bin/mrmuscle

Usage:
	> mrmuscle input.faa

Test:
	Test upon install by running mrmuscle
	> cd mrmuscle/test
	> mrmuscle test.faa

Pipeline Description:
	- Protein input in fasta format is preprocessed
	- MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment (maximum 1000 iterations)
	- Conversion to Nexus format
	- Postprocessing
	- MCMC tree generation using MrBayes to <0.01 standard deviation 
	  or 5M generations
	- Consensus tree summarized using MrBayes
	- Consensus opened in FigTree for user to manipulate tree
