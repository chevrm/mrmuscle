Summary:
MrMuscle is a pipeline for the creation of extremely high confidence phylogentic trees 
leveraging the MUSCLE sequence aligner and MrBayes Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo models.



Requirements (installed by install.sh):
	perl
	bioperl
	muscle
	mrbayes (mrbayes.sourceforge.net)
	figtree



Ensure all are installed by:
	./install-mm

If bioperl libraries have already been installed via alternatives from apt (CPAN, from source, 
etc), then invoke
	./install-mm-nobioperl



Usage:
	mrmuscle input.faa




Pipeline description:
	- Protein input file in fasta format is preprocessed
	- MUSCLE alignment to 1000 iterations
	- Conversion to Nexus format
	- Postprocessing
	- MCMC tree generation using MrBayes to standard deviation of <0.01 (max 5M 
	  generations)
	- Consensus tree generated
	- Opened in figtree
