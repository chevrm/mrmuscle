Summary:
	MrMuscle is a pipeline for the creation of extremely high confidence phylogentic trees 
	leveraging the MUSCLE sequence aligner and MrBayes Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo 
	models.

Installation:
	- Download master.zip from github.com/chevrm/mrmuscle
	- Unpack and run ./install-mm from within the master directory

	Note: for systems with bioperl installed from CPAN, source, or methods other than apt, 
	sh ./src/install-nobioperl.sh may be run instead of ./install-mm

Dependancies (installed by install-mm)
	- perl
	- bioperl
	- MUSCLE
	- MrBayes
	- FigTree

Usage:
	mrmuscle input.faa

Pipeline Description:
	- Protein input in fasta format is preprocessed
	- MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment (maximum 1000 iterations)
	- Conversion to Nexus format
	- Postprocessing
	- MCMC tree generation using MrBayes to <0.01 standard deviation or 5M generations
	- Consensus tree summarized using MrBayes
	- Consensus opened in FigTree for user to manipulate tree
